## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how decentralized and centralized finance interact.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how **smart-contract-patterns** (as a concept, not a specific product) integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### The Core Challenge: A Bridge Between Two Worlds

First, it's crucial to understand the fundamental disconnect:

*   **Smart Contracts** live on **decentralized** blockchains (like Ethereum, Solana). They are trustless, transparent, and execute automatically based on code.
*   **Major Exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)** are **centralized** entities (CEXs). They act as custodians of your funds and operate their own private, high-speed order books. You trade against their internal ledger, not directly on a blockchain.

**A smart contract cannot directly access or move funds held on Binance.** Your ETH on Coinbase is an IOU from Coinbase, not the actual on-chain ETH.

Therefore, integration is not direct. It happens through a bridge, primarily using **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**.
